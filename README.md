Spring Boot Assessment

<b>UPDATE: Managed to discover the error and amended it (It WORKS!!)</b>

- What did you like about this project?

Kinda missed working on HTML, CSS, JavaScript from scratch. The continuous enhancement of our frontend web project enabled me to remember how to do so!

- What did you struggle with in this project?

I have been trying for million years to figure what's the error - TypeError: Cannot set properties of null(setting 'innerHTML') or Error 405. 
Probably also because of the date, as I didn't convert it to String or utilize the Date package, so the client server cannot capture the HTTP request? Hence, I am unable to add task through my to do form!

- What would make your experience with this assessment better?

By resolving the error, and continue to work on the code. And if there's more time, will look into further enhancing the features and outlook of it.
